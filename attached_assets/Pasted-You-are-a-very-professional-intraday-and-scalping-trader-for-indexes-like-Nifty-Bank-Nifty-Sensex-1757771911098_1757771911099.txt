Everyday, whatever the market it is, I need to get the profit of minimum 1000 rupees. take real time data from angel if it ffail then yahoo finance also news if u need, add one more thing I want live signals just grab every oppurtunity along with above give me a single prompt which will do all these also a tab for papertrading


Add Live prices and also please check if any wrong predictions is running or mock data is there or dummy data is there, just take live prices and do as I am going to invest my real money in it believing in you


Step 1: Core Trading Brain

Build an AI-powered trading assistant that thinks like a professional intraday and scalping trader in Nifty, Bank Nifty, and Sensex.
The AI should:

Analyze historical and live market data.

Apply candlestick chart patterns (Doji, Engulfing, Hammer, Shooting Star, etc.).

Use technical indicators (VWAP, EMA crossover, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Supertrend).

Consider news & sentiment.

Generate buy/sell/hold signals with reasoning.

Ensure simulated strategies always attempt to make at least ₹1000 profit/day in all market conditions (bullish, bearish, sideways).

Step 2: Data Sources & Fallbacks

Connect to real-time data in this order:

Angel One API (primary)

Yahoo Finance (secondary)

NSE option chain API (fallback)
If all fail,no simulate dummy data tell me Data not available to keep the app running.

Step 3: Options Analysis Tab

Add a dedicated Options Tab for analyzing Option Chain data (Bank Nifty & Nifty).

Fetch Option Chain (CE & PE).

Analyze OI, IV, PCR, Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega).

Predict option price movement.

Suggest strategies like Straddle, Strangle, Iron Condor depending on market volatility.

Provide signals like “Buy PE 44500 @ ₹250, SL ₹180, Target ₹350”.

Step 4: Live Signals & Paper Trading

Add a Live Signals Tab to show AI-generated trade alerts in real time.

Example: “Scalp Buy: BankNifty 44900 CE @ ₹120, Target ₹140, SL ₹110”.

Continuously update signals based on price action.

Add a Paper Trading Tab where trades can be executed virtually with:

Trade history

P&L tracking

Daily report on profit/loss

Step 5: AI & UI Integration

Use Mistral + LLaMA (via OpenRouter API) for ML/AI analysis and reasoning.

AI should think like a human trader, adapting to market conditions.

Frontend should have 4 tabs:

Dashboard → Market overview, index levels, sentiment

Live Signals → Intraday & scalping trades

Options Analysis → Option chain insights & strategies

Paper Trading → Execute dummy trades & track P&L
